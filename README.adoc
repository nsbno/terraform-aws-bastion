A simple example of a bastion that is connected to a database.

== Usage

=== Connecting to the bastion

To connect to the bastion, you need to use the AWS CLI.

Here is an example of how to connect to a database in a private subnet:

[source, bash]
----
aws ssm start-session \
  --target i-1234567890abcdef0 \
  --document-name AWS-StartPortForwardingSession \
  --parameters host="database.vydev.io",portNumber="5432",localPortNumber="5432"
----

=== Creating the bastion

To create a bastion in your environment, add the root module to your `-aws` repo:

[source, hcl]
----
module "bastion" {
  source = "github.com/nsbno/terraform-aws-bastion?ref=x.y.z"

  vpc_id    = data.aws_vpc.this.id
  subnet_id = data.aws_subnets.private.ids[0]
}
----

Then, in your project repositories, you need to spesifically allow the bastion to connect to your resources.
This is done by adding the following to your project repositories:

[source, hcl]
----
module "bastion_to_database" {
  source = "github.com/nsbno/terraform-aws-bastion?ref=x.y.z//modules/bastion-connector"

  bastion_security_group_id = module.bastion.security_group_id
  target_security_group_id = data.aws_security_group.database.id

  port = 5432
}
----
